# Face-Generation
## Project Overview

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal of this project is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possble.

## Topics Covered
1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
2. Deep Convolutional GANs

## Libraries Used
The list below represents main libraries and its objects for the project.
- PyTorch (Generator and Discriminator)
